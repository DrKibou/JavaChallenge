/* This exercise is to test your understanding of Java Strings.
 * The elements of a String are called characters. The number of characters in a String is called the length, and it can be retrieved with the String.length() method.
 * Given two strings of lowercase English letters, A and B, perform the following operations:
 * 
 * Sum the lengths of  A and B.
 * Determine if A is lexicographically larger than B (i.e.: does B come before A in the dictionary?).
 * Capitalize the first letter in A and B and print them on a single line, separated by a space.
 * 
 * Input Format
 * The first line contains a string A. 
 * The second line contains another string B.
 * The strings are comprised of only lowercase English letters.
 * 
 * There are three lines of output:
 * For the first line, sum the lengths of A and B.
 * For the second line, write Yes if A is lexicographically greater than B otherwise print No instead.
 * For the third line, capitalize the first letter in both A and B and print them on a single line, separated by a space.
